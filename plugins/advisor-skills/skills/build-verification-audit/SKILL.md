description: "Verify that a build actually does what the agent claimed, before calling it done. Use when a build, app, feature, or workflow is wrapping up, when {{USER}} asks to audit or \"actually check\" something built with an AI agent, or at the natural end of any coding/build run — especially SBDC or client-facing tools. Triggers on \"audit this build\", \"did Claude actually do it\", \"verify this works\", \"is this production-ready\", \"check the auth/tests\", or end of a build run."

# Build Verification Audit

At the end of a build run — or whenever {{USER}} asks to verify something built with an AI agent — do not trust the building session's own report that the work is done. An AI agent produces the *plausible* next action, not a *verified* one; "I added authentication" is the likely sentence to emit after that task, not evidence the auth exists. This skill re-derives evidence and checks it against what was actually asked for.

This is the sibling to the Durable Learning Protocol: same "end of run" hook, same ledger, but it verifies the build instead of consolidating learnings. Run it before declaring a build production-ready, especially for SBDC or anything that touches real client data.

## The Core Rule

**Verification must sit outside the system that produced the work.** Never satisfy this audit by asking the building session "did you do it?" — it will say yes. Re-derive the evidence independently: run the app and walk the flow, read the actual code and tests yourself, or spawn a separate subagent to check. If none of those are possible in-session, say so plainly and mark the item unverified rather than passing it.

## The Contract Frame

Audit each deliverable against four questions. Treat the agent as an untrusted contractor bound by a contract.

1. **Agreed delivery** — What exactly was this supposed to do? If the spec was one big blob, break it into the discrete behaviors that were promised.
2. **Constraints** — What was it told *not* to do (don't store PII in plaintext, don't touch payment logic, don't fake tests)? Check these as hard as the delivery — how something was built often matters as much as whether it works.
3. **Proof** — Is there a concrete artifact showing the behavior working in the live app (a walked-through flow, a screenshot, real output) — not just a claim in prose?
4. **Verification** — Was that proof checked independently, outside the building agent? (See Core Rule.)
5. **Ownership** — Is this a task an agent could actually complete, or one only a human can (needs access the agent lacks, real credentials, a real send)? Human-owned items can't be marked done by the agent — flag them for {{USER}}.

## The Standing Failure Checklist

These are the failures that recur in AI-built apps. Check every one that applies; do not assume any is fine because the agent said so.

- **Auth that doesn't authenticate.** Can you register with an email you don't own? Is there real verification that the email/identity belongs to the user? Does password reset actually work end to end?
- **Access control that doesn't control.** Does "suspend" / "remove" / "revoke" actually cut off access? Can one logged-in user reach another user's data?
- **Tests written to pass, not to test.** Read the tests. Do they assert the *intended* behavior, or just whatever the code currently does? A green "100% passing" run proves nothing if the assertions were reverse-engineered from the implementation.
- **Broken non-happy-path workflows.** The demo path works; the edge paths (bad input, empty state, error, back button, refresh mid-flow) were often never exercised.
- **Data handling.** For SBDC/client tools: is any client PII, financial detail, or identifier stored or logged where it shouldn't be? This is a constraint failure and matters most here.

## How To Run It

1. List the deliverables that were promised this run.
2. For each, run the Contract Frame + the relevant Failure Checklist items, re-deriving evidence independently.
3. Report per item: **verified** (with the evidence), **failed** (with what's broken), or **unverified** (couldn't check in-session, and why).
4. Do not call the build done while any critical item — auth, access control, client-data handling — is failed or unverified.

## Logging Findings

Per-build pass/fail is reported in-session, not stored — no new persistent file.

But when the audit surfaces a *recurring trap worth remembering* (a mistake pattern that would help future builds avoid it), record it as a Durable Learning Protocol pitfall. If the gstack durable learning system is available, append to the project learnings store at `{{HOME}}\.gstack\projects\bwfnx-wikis\`:

- Hot row to `learnings.jsonl`, cold row to `learnings-evidence.jsonl`, 1:1, with `type: "pitfall"` and the correct `namespace` (`global|fnx-pearl|sbdc|northfork|personal`). Keep contexts separate.
- Only save when both `confidence` and `usefulness` are 8 or higher; otherwise propose it. Do not include client PII, account numbers, or financial specifics.
- Run `python validate-learnings.py` afterward. Write JSONL as UTF-8 without a BOM.

If write access isn't available, list proposed pitfall learnings at the end for {{USER}} to save.

Example pitfall worth logging: `insight: "AI-built login flows default to no email-ownership verification — always test registering with an email you don't control before shipping."`, `namespace: "sbdc"`, `type: "pitfall"`.
